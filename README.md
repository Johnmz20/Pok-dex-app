# Pokêdex app
## About:
The Application is a pokédex of the Kanto region that holds 150 different Pokémon species with different types, abilities, and evolutions. I used API to get the information and put it into buttons when clicking on a specific pokemon a modal will appear with the basic knowledge of the pokemon. This project was fun to create since im a Pokémon fan, I hope I will create another application of the Unova region as this is my favorite pokemon generation.
